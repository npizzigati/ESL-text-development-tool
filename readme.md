### Text instructions:
### Point your browser to https://esl-text-development-tool.onrender.com/
(Chrome or a Chrome-based browser recommended)

### Upload Your [headwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headword) file.
The file should be plain text, with each headword on a separate line and no other information. Headwords should be ordered by word frequency, with the most frequently appearing words first.

A 1000-word frequency list in MS Excel format is available at http://www.newgeneralservicelist.org/s/NGSL-101-by-band-qq9o.xlsx. Just copy column A into a plain text file (extension .txt).

### Create Your Text
You can now begin entering your text in the editor pane to the left. Words contained in your headwords list will be black as you enter them, while words not in the list will be gray.

The rightmost pane, the "official list," lists all your headwords, along with their general frequency rank and the frequency they appear in your text.

The middle pane default tab, the "auto list," lists only the headwords that appear in your text, in the order in which they appear.

Clicking on any headword in the official list pane will highlight all the appearance(s) of the word in the main editor pane, including its inflections, as well as the headword in the auto list pane.

Clicking on a headword in the auto list pane will highlight the first appearance of that headword (or its inflection) in the main editor pane, along with the headword in the official list pane.

Clicking on a word in the main editor pane will also highlight the corresponding headword in the other two panes.

### Saving Your Work

Your text is automatically saved to your browser's local storage as you write it, and can be recovered if need be by clicking on the recovery link provided when the application starts up. You can work on different texts in different tabs and separate recovery files will be saved for each tab, up to a maximum of 20. When recovering, the different files are identified by the time they were last edited.

To move your text out of the editor and save it in a different location, simply copy and paste to your new file.

### Importing Texts

Texts can be pasted into the editor and the frequency lists will automatically update.

The "Assumed Words" Tab

If there are any words in your headwords file that you would not like to include in the frequency counts (because, for example, you assume your students already know them), you can exclude these words by entering them into the "assumed words" list, which you can access by clicking on the tab to the right of the "auto words" tab (in the middle pane).
